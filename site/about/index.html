<p>John Laudun is Professor of English at the University of Louisiana, where his research focuses on computational models of discourse, especially narratives, and how they cascade through socio-cultural networks both online and off. In addition to his work on folk narrative and the intellectual history of folklore studies, he has published an ethnographic study, <em>The Amazing Crawfish Boat</em> (University Press of Mississippi, 2016), that uses actor-network theory to understand creativity and tradition. His work has appeared in a variety of academic journals and edited volumes, as well as cited in newspaper and documentaries. He has been a Jacob K. Javits Fellow, a MacArthur Scholar, a fellow at the EVIA Digital Archive, a fellow with the  Institute on Network Studies in the Humanities, and a senior researcher at UCLA&rsquo;s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics.</p>
