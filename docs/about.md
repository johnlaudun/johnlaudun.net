## Colophon

This site is built using GitHub pages and [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org). The CSS is a modified (simplified really) version of the mkdocs theme [Alabaster](https://github.com/notpushkin/mkdocs-alabaster). The site is still transitioning to open source type faces, with Alegreya, which for now are drawn from Google's font system.
