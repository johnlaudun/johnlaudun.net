title: About
---

John Laudun is Professor of English at the University of Louisiana, where his research focuses on computational models of discourse, especially narratives, and how they cascade through socio-cultural networks both online and off. In addition to his work on folk narrative and the intellectual history of folklore studies, he has published an ethnographic study, _The Amazing Crawfish Boat_ (University Press of Mississippi, 2016), that uses actor-network theory to understand creativity and tradition among craftsmen and farmers living and working on a Louisiana landscape. His work has appeared in a variety of academic journals and edited volumes, and he has been cited or interviewed in newspapers and documentaries. He has been a Jacob K. Javits Fellow, a MacArthur Scholar, a fellow at the EVIA Digital Archive, a fellow with the  Institute on Network Studies in the Humanities, and a senior researcher at UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics.

Like everyone else, I am rather overwhelmed by the number of sites that seek to collect the work we do. So, while I am appear on [ORCID][], [Publons][], and [ResearchGate][], I cannot guarantee the currency of any of those listings. (That is what this site is supposed to do, and, in a different moment, those sites would aggregate a site like this using something like RSS, but that moment in the history of the internet appears to have passed.)

## Colophon

This site is built using and is itself open source. It is served thanks to the functionality of [GitHub pages][]. It is built with the Python library [mkdocs][], which harnesses the power of [Sphinx][]. The CSS is a modified (simplified really) version of the mkdocs theme [Alabaster][]. The entirety of the site is available for viewing, and for download, at its [GitHub repo][]. View, and/or use, the code at your own risk. I am still learning mkdocs and [Sphinx][], but, for those interested, there is also an amazing collection of [MkDocs plug-ins][].
