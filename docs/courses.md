# Courses

The courses listed below are ones I imagine teaching in a context where both close and distant reading, where both computation and cogitation, feature equally in the treatment of texts.

* [Introduction to Text Analytics](course-lower.md)
* [The Spread of (Mis)Information](course-upper.md)
* [What We Think When We Think about Machine Thinking](course-ai.md)

While I have never taught these courses as they are sketched out here, they are based on units or features of courses or workshops I have conducted.
