My principal interest is in understanding how stories are constructed, deployed, and received both because of the ways narrative activates our imaginations and the ways that narrative as one of many modes of discourse seems able to make words stick together as they travel across social networks. My focus on the somewhat larger horizon of discourse, as opposed to strictly narrative, is the outcome of years of close examination of actual vernacular texts as they passed between individuals both in face-to-face interaction and online. While I began this work in folklore studies, I have over the past few years sought to expand the scope of my engagement in order to find those areas of overlap that exist between the humanities, the social sciences, and data and information science in the belief that there is not only strength in diverse perspectives and collaborations but also real opportunity to find tractable insights into larger questions and problems facing the world in which we live and work. In addition to the usual places to publish, indexed in the vita , I maintain a number of repositories on GitHub , including the current collaboration with Katherine M. Kinnaird of Smith College on TED Talks, whose current state can be glimpsed by anyone curious. My teaching focuses as much as it can with students engaging data/materials they collect, either from conversations they initiate in face-to-face interactions or through curating online assets, in the belief that it is only in doing the work for themselves, facing the problems scholars and scientists face at various stages of a project, can they not only learn the fundamentals of scholarship and science but also begin to have an appreciation for the larger processes at work in their environment each and every day. Student-driven projects include treatments of women\u2019s narrative traditions in Cajun country, rH+ mythologies among alt-right groups, African American ghost legends, Youtube apologies and their attendant folk criticism, and faux reviews of sex toys on Amazon and on podcasts among many other topics. (If you want to see what my students see, then here are my teaching materials \u2013 also built using MkDocs.) I have enjoyed a number of experiences that have made me the scholar I am today, including a special conference organized on the Council for European Philosophy on the oeuvre of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, an NEH seminar on Network Studies in the Humanities, a long program by UCLA\u2019s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics on cultural analytics, as well as several weeks at the EVIA Digital Archive to deposit materials from my work on Cajun Mardi Gras and the stories of a Creole woman. Since 2004, I have maintained a weblog , basing it on an early version of WordPress. I have, over the years, tried other setups, but it\u2019s just been such a reliable tool/resource over the years \u2026 it just works. I have posted a lot of material on the blog over the years, but, to be honest, the technical material gets the most attention: e.g., the most popular post at this point is about how to Append a Python List Using a List Comprehension . I have been a faculty member at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette since 1999, and before that I received my PhD from Indiana University - Bloomington. I took time off during my work on the doctorate to be a management development consultant with IU Gradudate School of Business. My M.A. is from Syracuse University, where I focused on the nature of texts and their production and reception as well as learned to play the guitar. My B.A. in English and philosophy is from Louisiana State University, where I put myself through school either working construction jobs in the Louisiana summer sun or producing television commercials for a regional department store chain \u2013 I mis-type interest to this day because the Olivetti on which I worked always jammed at est .

I grew up benefiting from the cultures of the South having long been porous but their societies being not only fenced but stratified. As much as I would like it all to be different now, it\u2019s not. My goal is to do what I can as a researcher, teacher, and member of my community to make things a bit better here and a bit better there, in the hopes that the bits as a part of that long arc that bends toward justice. In my past research I have written on African American literature and folklore with the goal of making clear the sophistication behind forms that others have mistaken for simple or inconsequential. One aspect of my current research focuses on online legends and fake news, which are often sites, and acts, that prey on individual fears that can then be collectively harnessed and aimed at inappropriate objects, creating an environment in which it is not only acceptable but forward-thinking to take children from their families and lock them up. (And, if you think online legends and rumors are difficult to accept, you should try doing field research in communities where those narratives circulate.) One possible collaboration moving forward is with Brandeis Marshall who has a robust collection of tweets from Black Twitter: we are interested in seeing if we can take recent advances in sarcasm detection to see if they can reveal uses of African American ways of speaking, and now of tweeting, sometimes known as signifying. The university where I now teach has the proud legacy of being one of the first in the state to desegregate and to do so peacefully. Our student population averages about one-third African American, with a small but steady stream of students from Vietnamese and, increasingly, Latin American communities. The joy of being a folklorist is encouraging students to base their projects on things they know from their own communities, however they wish to define it \u2013 and it is important to remember that some students, especially those exploring their identities for the first time without close familial supervision, do not necessarily identify in ethnic terms but in other alternate terms that can be just as energizing if we allow them space to do so but also the necessary structure to do so productively. So, yes, I have been there at the birth of projects focused on treasure legends in an all-black town, a study of La Llorona sightings on Youtube, or an examination of cucking on 4chan. In some cases these students are first-generation, and in others they are from school systems that strain to keep buildings from collapsing, and so one of the things I have learned is important is to assess where students are in order to make adjustments to get them where they need to be in order to do their best work possible. Sometimes this means simply listening, which is a skill I first really learned while doing fieldwork among urban Appalachians in Cincinnati, Ohio and African Americans in southern Indiana. Sometimes listening is the best action we can take. But addressing students needs is but one task of many at a university, and adjusting curricula to reflect student needs and interests on a departmental committee as well as participating in the oversight of research focused on minority populations as part of the Institutional Review Board are the kinds of activities that begin to address larger, institutional biases and encourage an institution to understand the necessity for highlighting diversity at a variety of levels. The same is true for groups and committees in the scholarly and scientific societies we populate: when tasked with forming a committee, I always sought out a diverse group with the hopes of finding voices that would be critical of everything that we forgot or overlooked or assumed. (The same goes for declining invitations when I felt like a committee already had enough people who were like me: sure I\u2019m aware of the issues, but I don\u2019t live the issues the way others do and they need to be there with that experience and not me with my awareness.) Finally, we not only work in this world but we also live in it. As a member of a family with readily apparent mixed ethnicities, I feel I have a personal responsibility to do what I can to open the eyes of ordinary people who need to understand that things they take for granted or things of which they are afraid are often based on events that never happened or ideas that do not hold up to closer examination. Part of that commitment is a steady stream of workshops or talks or whatever else is called for at area festivals, schools, libraries, and organizations. I have talked about Creole narrative traditions at the Zydeco Festival in Plaisance and about networked creativity to the Jaycees in Eunice. This is not always easy, given some of the things that happen, but it\u2019s the only way I know that at least doesn\u2019t contribute to making things worse and maybe, just maybe, makes things better.","title":"Diversity Statement"},{"location":"diversity/#diversity-statement","text":"Growing up in the Deep South, I witnessed first-hand the toll intolerance takes on a society: as a child, I swam in pools that still were \u201cwhites only\u201d (with no signs, but the stricture was just as clear), and as a teenager I grieved alone when my grandfather died, because all the black men I had grown up with while at his side didn\u2019t feel comfortable coming to the white funeral home.

My principle interest is in narrative texts, in understanding how they are constructed, deployed, and received both because of the ways narrative activates our imaginations and the ways that narrative, as one of many modes of discourse, seems able to make words stick together as they travel across social networks. My focus on the somewhat larger horizon of discourse, as opposed to strictly narrative, is the outcome of years of close examination of actual vernacular texts as they passed between individuals both in face-to-face interaction and online. While I began this work in folklore studies, I have over the past few years sought to expand the scope of my engagement in order to find those areas of overlap that exist between the humanities, the social sciences, and data and information science in the belief that there is not only strength in diverse perspectives and collaborations but also real opportunity to find tractable insights into larger questions and problems facing the world in which we live and work. My current research streams converge on the nature of narrative because I am particularly interested in refining our understanding of modes of discourse so that we can more successfully not only distinguish narrative from other kinds of texts but build a better model of narrative itself. Addressing this question draws on work in folklore studies, information science, cognitive science, corpus linguistics (and stylistics), and computational approaches to the humanities and social sciences. One strand of this work focuses on legends, all of which have long been distributed by traditional (oral) social networks, but many of which first made great leaps in distance via the first information networks constituted by regional, and later international, newspaper networks. While the project to make the historical case is still underway, contemporary manifestations in the 2016 clown legend cascade and the recurring legend of abandoned trucks highlight the ways in which off-line and on-line social networks not only amplify each other but transform the information that passes through them in ways we have not fully documented. This work established the need for closer scrutiny of legend as a form as well as the need to consider alternate methods for evaluating the way legends spread and/or saturate on/off-line social networks. At the heart of this lies the nature, and status, of narrative itself, a much vaunted but still remarkably not well understood mode of discourse. My efforts here are to understand how individuals use narrative to shape various dimensions of the world as they understand it: time, space, the interactional order. The goal of this work is to build a computational model of narrative such that we can discern narrative from other modes of discourse and begin to understand its place within the larger stream of vernacular discourse, themselves situated within global information flows. One argument, for example, has been that the cognitive mirroring enabled by narrative helps in the spread of fake news and in radicalization processes. And yet the status of legends as narrative within folklore studies has long been subject to discussion, calling into question the narrative nature of those forms which rest upon legend, like fake news. A proper accounting of narrative within legend and fake news would go a long way to clarifying the dynamics of these phenomena. The relevance of form to our understanding of information flows is at the heart of the collaboration with Katherine Kinnaird of Smith College. Taking TED talks as a corpus upon which we can build a set of methodologies and tests various assumptions, we have, first, established a clean data set available to anyone. Second, we examine the talks as words, performing not only the usual inspections of topics across time and domain but also attending to matters of gender and seeking to understand the relationship between TED talks, often described as \u201cthought leading,\u201d and information flows contemporary with them. In the process, we have uncovered profitable forms of collaboration and dialogue that we are capturing in Me Think Pretty One Day a book focused on collaboration between humanities and the data sciences (under development). The oldest strand of work that continues to generate some activity began in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes that struck Louisiana, when I embarked upon an exploration of the relationship between culture and landscape. Driven to understand how individuals worked and lived in places dismissed as wetlands, I discovered a tradition of invention that had developed the crawfish boat, an amphibious vehicle that tumbled out of a loose network of Cajun and German farmers and fabricators. Explaining this phenomenon required actor-network theory, and I continue to refine that work as a way of engaging my home discipline of folklore studies in the necessity of re-thinking our work in light of developments in network theory.","title":"Research Statement"},{"location":"research/#research-statement","text":"My work in cultural analytics / folklore studies is focused on understanding the role that discourse plays in the nature and spread of online and offline texts.

It helps that the study of vernacular discourse in general, and its traditional forms (i.e., folklore) in particular, has long been pushed to one edge of the divide with literature and the arts occupying the center. Across the divide lies linguistics and those facets of the human sciences that address the individual and the particular. Introducing a focus on data and on step-by-step forms of analysis enables the kind of grounding in scientific and scholarly methods that students not only need but makes it possible for them to participate in ways they have not imagined. At the heart of any humanities course is a text, but the practice of interpreting texts remains for most a mystic process conducted by hermeneutic priests or impresarios. One way to pull back the curtain on the mystery, and to align work in the humanities with that in the sciences, is to consider texts data and thus available for the kind of \u201cmechanical\u201d breakdown that we expect of cells, chemicals, or algorithms. That is, texts are machines made of words. They produce distinct meanings that can be enumerated based on which words are used and the order in which they occur. It\u2019s that simple. The demystification process can, in advanced classes, take on the use of either established tools, available in a variety of forms (websites or standalone software) or hand-written functions in Python. In lower-level classes, we start with printouts and lots of marking, compile various patterns into spreadsheets, and then enact our insights in a variety of seemingly simple activities that underline for students the effectiveness of such ways of thinking. One such activity assigns each student in a class a page from a text, and then asks them to determine the one sentence on that page that best represents what happens on it. Students then compile their sentences, checking for redundancy and combining for overlap (which also allows them to see the power of revision as well as complex syntax), to generate a summary that everyone can use and driving home the analyzability of texts. As students move through the various stages of breaking a text into its constituent parts and then re-assembling those parts into useful analytical units, like counts of particular words or a summary of a passage, they themselves move in and out of small groups, individual tasks, and larger, whole-class discussions and activities. One of my concomitant goals is to underline the various dimensions of interaction that make up the practice of science and scholarship, with the utility of sometimes working alone, sometimes with others, and sometimes having to communicate across a larger group necessary, and valuable, parts of the process. Too often students come into the university classroom with ideas of solitary genius or that the only authentic ideas, and productivity, are individual in nature. Getting them to experience ideas coming from different moments and different kinds of interactions for themselves is an integral part of my pedagogy. Given the amount of misinformation about science to which they are exposed \u2014 what is a theory (e.g., \u201cevolution is just a theory\u201d) or how peer review works (e.g., \u201cthis website proves vaccines cause autism\u201d) \u2014 it is important that students enact the process as often and as much as they can for themselves. Practice is everything. Obviously, one of the chief sources of information for students are the various online milieu through which they seemingly drift as their own bodies drift into and out of classrooms and campus buildings. Their attention spans are a regular admixture of critical concepts and memes, and as a member of a field focused on addressing memes and fake news, one of the advantages I enjoy is delivering concepts and methods for treating memes and fake news as material worthy of serious examination. Combining folklore studies with information science, we examine how offline and online communities, instantiated largely through the texts they exchange, enable certain kinds of ideas and disable others. We draw upon studies of folklore conduits as well as considerations of cascades and virality. The aim in these courses is to prepare students for their own research topics, where they will create small collections of data drawn from online sources and then apply those theoretical frameworks which best address the patterns and dimensions that interest them. Over the iterations of teaching in this way, I have enjoyed the elicitation of the folk critique of YouTube apologies, the careful description of Rh+ conspiracies as mythology, and the Cicada mystery as a nested intertextual nexus mirroring the web itself. These projects typically occupy much of the latter half of a semester, with students working both individually as well as in small \u201ccluster interest\u201d groups, helping each other to discover both primary and secondary sources as well as offering initial critiques of writing. Because communication in general and writing in particular is such an important skill, we spend time in and out of class often working paragraph by paragraph. This is not new to students in my courses: much of the reading for courses, especially at the upper-level, is drawn from scholarly and scientific publications, both because I want them to practice reading such publications but also because we spend some time within any treatment of a given work examining how it is organized as a document. By the time it is their turn to write, they are familiar with the kinds of paragraphs that constitute such writing and the sections in which it is organized. One of the things regularly featured during such discussions is the observation \u201cIs this great writing? No. Does it get the job done? Yes.\u201d Writing is hard. Whatever it takes to get students to write early and often is one of my central tasks. Some students will go on to practice reading and writing, analysis and synthesis as part of their daily work lives. Others will, I hope, have practiced it enough in the class that they will recognize when it has occurred and when it has not or when they need to flex a long-unused muscle. Given the spread of unscientific, and even anti-scientific, perspectives, this ability to recognize when a text is likely the result, or not, of the scientific/scholarly process is a critical one for university students to possess as they leave our classrooms and begin their work and lives out in the world. As part of my commitment to making the world \u201cout there\u201d more familiar with the content and methods that are central to our work in the academy, I am regularly involved in community workshops, interviewed by various publications (including the New York Times once), and give talks to regional organizations. One long-standing relationship is with the Evangeline Council of the Boy Scouts which first approached me about constructing a time capsule. That conversation led to a much larger discussion about what kind of data might be collected by scouts involved in their newly developed Swamp Trek program, and how we might fold such \u201ccitizen science\u201d initiatives focused on nature into participatory workshops on regional folk cultures. That program now reaches several hundred scouts from across the nation every year, and driving across the Atchafalaya Basin now reminds me that somewhere a scout is learning about how a toilet flushed in the Plains has an impact on the flora and fauna of the Mississippi Delta and that people have lived on this seemingly confused landscape for hundreds, perhaps, thousands of years.","title":"Teaching Statement"},{"location":"teaching/#teaching-statement","text":"One of my goals when I teach folklore studies is to undermine the divide that students seem to think exists between the humanities and the sciences. It helps that the study of vernacular discourse in general, and its traditional forms (i.e., folklore) in particular, has long been pushed to one edge of the divide with literature and the arts occupying the center. Across the divide lies linguistics and those facets of the human sciences that address the individual and the particular. Introducing a focus on data and on step-by-step forms of analysis enables the kind of grounding in scientific and scholarly methods that students not only need but makes it possible for them to participate in ways they have not imagined. At the heart of any humanities course is a text, but the practice of interpreting texts remains for most a mystic process conducted by hermeneutic priests or impresarios. One way to pull back the curtain on the mystery, and to align work in the humanities with that in the sciences, is to consider texts data and thus available for the kind of \u201cmechanical\u201d breakdown that we expect of cells, chemicals, or algorithms. That is, texts are machines made of words. They produce distinct meanings that can be enumerated based on which words are used and the order in which they occur. It\u2019s that simple. The demystification process can, in advanced classes, take on the use of either established tools, available in a variety of forms (websites or standalone software) or hand-written functions in Python. In lower-level classes, we start with printouts and lots of marking, compile various patterns into spreadsheets, and then enact our insights in a variety of seemingly simple activities that underline for students the effectiveness of such ways of thinking. One such activity assigns each student in a class a page from a text, and then asks them to determine the one sentence on that page that best represents what happens on it. Students then compile their sentences, checking for redundancy and combining for overlap (which also allows them to see the power of revision as well as complex syntax), to generate a summary that everyone can use and driving home the analyzability of texts. As students move through the various stages of breaking a text into its constituent parts and then re-assembling those parts into useful analytical units, like counts of particular words or a summary of a passage, they themselves move in and out of small groups, individual tasks, and larger, whole-class discussions and activities. One of my concomitant goals is to underline the various dimensions of interaction that make up the practice of science and scholarship, with the utility of sometimes working alone, sometimes with others, and sometimes having to communicate across a larger group necessary, and valuable, parts of the process. Too often students come into the university classroom with ideas of solitary genius or that the only authentic ideas, and productivity, are individual in nature. Getting them to experience ideas coming from different moments and different kinds of interactions for themselves is an integral part of my pedagogy. Given the amount of misinformation about science to which they are exposed \u2014 what is a theory (e.g., \u201cevolution is just a theory\u201d) or how peer review works (e.g., \u201cthis website proves vaccines cause autism\u201d) \u2014 it is important that students enact the process as often and as much as they can for themselves. Practice is everything. Obviously, one of the chief sources of information for students are the various online milieu through which they seemingly drift as their own bodies drift into and out of classrooms and campus buildings. Their attention spans are a regular admixture of critical concepts and memes, and as a member of a field focused on addressing memes and fake news, one of the advantages I enjoy is delivering concepts and methods for treating memes and fake news as material worthy of serious examination. Combining folklore studies with information science, we examine how offline and online communities, instantiated largely through the texts they exchange, enable certain kinds of ideas and disable others. We draw upon studies of folklore conduits as well as considerations of cascades and virality. The aim in these courses is to prepare students for their own research topics, where they will create small collections of data drawn from online sources and then apply those theoretical frameworks which best address the patterns and dimensions that interest them. Over the iterations of teaching in this way, I have enjoyed the elicitation of the folk critique of YouTube apologies, the careful description of Rh+ conspiracies as mythology, and the Cicada mystery as a nested intertextual nexus mirroring the web itself. These projects typically occupy much of the latter half of a semester, with students working both individually as well as in small \u201ccluster interest\u201d groups, helping each other to discover both primary and secondary sources as well as offering initial critiques of writing. Because communication in general and writing in particular is such an important skill, we spend time in and out of class often working paragraph by paragraph. This is not new to students in my courses: much of the reading for courses, especially at the upper-level, is drawn from scholarly and scientific publications, both because I want them to practice reading such publications but also because we spend some time within any treatment of a given work examining how it is organized as a document. By the time it is their turn to write, they are familiar with the kinds of paragraphs that constitute such writing and the sections in which it is organized. One of the things regularly featured during such discussions is the observation \u201cIs this great writing? No. Does it get the job done? Yes.\u201d Writing is hard. Whatever it takes to get students to write early and often is one of my central tasks. Some students will go on to practice reading and writing, analysis and synthesis as part of their daily work lives. Others will, I hope, have practiced it enough in the class that they will recognize when it has occurred and when it has not or when they need to flex a long-unused muscle. Given the spread of unscientific, and even anti-scientific, perspectives, this ability to recognize when a text is likely the result, or not, of the scientific/scholarly process is a critical one for university students to possess as they leave our classrooms and begin their work and lives out in the world. As part of my commitment to making the world \u201cout there\u201d more familiar with the content and methods that are central to our work in the academy, I am regularly involved in community workshops, interviewed by various publications (including the New York Times once), and give talks to regional organizations.

When I came across an announcement for the conference, I recognized that it sat precisely at the intersection of an N-dimensional space with the following axes: the first, and primary, axis is my work as a folklorist to document and to attempt to understand how it is human beings think their way through the world. The second axis is my own attempts to learn how, first, simply to write code, then to work collaboratively with a mathematician and machine learning specialist through code. The third axis is my interest, as a parent of a child who is primarily a world-builder, in finding ways of thinking about thinking and thus thinking about teaching that are conducive to fostering her intellectual, and thus also her emotional, growth. My field of folklore studies is designed, mostly de facto, to force awkward encounters between the modern and the non-modern. That is its intellectual history. Like other outward-looking dimensions of the nineteenth century\u2019s philological project \u2014 which also includes certain parts of anthropology, linguistics, and sociology \u2014 folklore studies asks that its practitioners go out into the world, spend time among some group of them, and then come back to report on how it is with them. The explicit contract, and contrast, is that our society, our modern society, is too complex to understand in toto, and so if we study primitive or peasant societies, they will, through their smallness and/or their simpleness, offer us the chance to understand how it is human societies in general work. Thus, we seek to understand them in order to understand us. Constructing an other is, as we have realized since this mission was founded (starting really before the nineteenth century), not without its problems. Still, folklorists like myself press on, attempting to bring our field and the knowledge it produces more clearly in line with our more nuanced understanding of what it means to create and apply knowledge after Foucault and other post-structuralists necessarily complicated things. So it was with all those qualifications and revisions and concerns in mind that I found myself deciding to spend a number of years seeking to understand how a small network of individuals, working with quite modern materials like steel, aluminum, and hydraulics and with quite modern tools like arc welders, press breaks, and acetylene torches could first conceive and then steadily refine a machine that changed an entire agricultural economy. And they did it all using only what they already knew, whatever that may mean, because then I could call it traditional, and, as it turns out, it was. And so I spent seven years following fabricators and farmers attempting to understand not only the amazing machine they had willed into being but how that machine reflected their own, native understanding of the landscape on which they worked and the world within which they imagined themselves. (For those interested, I wrote an entire book about it.) There were a number of dimensions to the work but the one I wish to focus on here is how ideas get made in the world. Linguists and computer scientists have long described languages that people use in the world to communicate directly with each other and those they use to communicate with computers as natural languages. Natural languages are distinct from formal languages, such as those used in programming, and constructed languages, such as those developed to standardize communication. It would not be unacceptable to extend the concept of \u201cnatural\u201d used in this way to describe natural knowledge construction (or NKC) as the way that humans construct knowledge when they are in communication with each other. Such a description of NKC captures that such knowledge can exist alongside, and often in dialogue with, formal knowledges that users have received either through various formal education protocols and processes: schools and workshops, in particular, play a large role in the agricultural communities in which the current case study takes place. We have not thought as clearly about the relationships between the kinds knowledge available to us because we have, until this moment, not needed to, both because the varieties of practical knowledge were quite strong and also because propositional knowledge did not, as it does in the age mass distribution combined with automated, well, everything, threaten to make practical knowledge unnecessary. In any discussion we might have following the case study, it will be worth our while to consider the necessary balance practical knowledge brings to knowledge in general and, in fact, the enhancements it offers to any epistemology. But before we proceed to the case study I must confess that I am blurring two levels of abstraction in my treatment of this matter: it strikes me that there are actually three ways of treating knowledge: as a theory, as a practice, and in between those two lies history. What I offer here is a narrative in hopes of giving you some sense of the operations at work in a very real context. \u00ab\u00bb The crawfish boat offers us a window onto natural knowledge construction: its recent development and its use of modern materials and modern construction techniques make it a fringe case for studies of traditional knowledge. The diffuse, informal, heterogeneous network which gave birth to it, and its unclear timeline, make it less compelling to historians of technology. Its small economic footprint makes it uninteresting to economists and business theorists, and its lack of formality in its creation also makes it uninteresting to engineers: the first time I visited one shop, in fact, the owner walked me out to one of his CAM machines and asked me what did I want to know? (I told him I didn\u2019t care one whit for the machines: that everything I wanted to know was inside his head. This got me a peculiar look, but he let me come back again and again.) The birth of the crawfish boat was a moment of opportunism, relying upon the fact that crawfish are native to Louisiana and that the creatures had long been easily caught in any low-lying area prone to flooding. There are oral histories that report crawfish migrations that shut down roads because the sheer volume of the animals made the roads too slick to pass. A great aunt of mine reported grabbing crawfish out of flooded fields with a slotted spoon and an old pot. In her account, the children would give them to the poor people, and in the early twentieth century crawfish were seen as a lower-class food. Post-depression and later war-time nutritional programs touted the crawfish as a valuable, abundant, and cheap source of protein, and that message was redoubled during the cultural renaissance that took place in south Louisiana beginning after the war and taking place alongside the Civil Rights movement. By the late fifties, the town of Breaux Bridge had started its annual Crawfish Festival. Much of the early commercial crawfishing was done in the nearby Atchafalaya swamp, which had been formalized into a flood basin by the federal government following the 1929 flood. The boats and traps used there required little modification from boats and traps used in other applications. At some point in the sixties, however, farmers and landowners started playing with the idea of harvesting crawfish out of flooded fields. To some degree, this was a natural development of people looking for flooded land to crawfish, and there are some anecdotal accounts, perhaps apocryphal (and by apocryphal I mean backward-looking explanations), that it was an outgrowth of some of the fierce hurricanes that inundated Louisiana in the late fifties and in the sixties. By the seventies, rice farmers were regularly allowing people to crawfish otherwise unused fields for pennies on the pound of crawfish. (The economics of crawfish were, from the start, a cash crop that was un- or under-assessed and that made profitable use of fields otherwise lying fallow.) Slowly, it became clear that more money could be made if the farmers harvested the crop for themselves, and it was during the late seventies that a great deal of experimentation occurred. At first, farmers themselves, or often their children pressed into service, ran the fields by placing traps along the perimeter and walking from trap to trap with two five-gallon buckets, one for bait and one for harvested crawfish. Ramping up such an enterprise, and attempting to work inside a cut often involved pulling a bulky boat or, in many cases, towing a bright-blue children\u2019s pool, an image the farmers themselves recall with wry grins. As yields increased, farmers began to want to scale up the process, to bring the same kind of power they enjoyed farming into crawfishing. These were men, as will be discussed in a moment, who were comfortable with a wide variety of farm gear, and, just as important, most had some knowledge of and experience in making or modifying an implement in their own shops or equipment sheds. What happened next is not entirely clear. Memories in the present must reach back forty years and try to piece together, through reference to other events\u2014 often to when a child was born or to what grade they were in\u2014 that otherwise blend together as part of \u201clife on a farm.\u201d The first boats that were built were mechanically driven, with a small engine, five horsepower by most accounts. What exactly they were driving is not immediately clear. A number of folks have described a variety of pulley-and-cable systems that seem better suited to steerage than to powering a boat. More than once I have heard them labeled contraptions, as if that was all there was to say on the subject. Whatever the form of those first few protoboats, they seem to have had the drive unit in the back, similar to the contemporary boats. Out of this initial period of experimentation emerged, in the very late seventies, the \u201ctiller-foot\u201d boat. Like its predecessor, it was built on lightweight boat hulls that were commercially available with the addition of a most extraordinary assemblage: the lower part of a garden rotary tiller driven by a five-horsepower engine separated by a long boom, made in place. At first one steered the machines with a tiller attached to the assembled drive unit, much like you would the outboard motor of a boat, but eventually someone adapted the power-steering cylinder of a car so that steering could be handled more remotely. The tiller-foot boats were used for a number of years, but the fact that the drive units were assembled from such disparate parts meant the units were short-lived: the transmission gears, often made of brass, were not intended for such intensive use and would typically fail within a year\u2019s time. The widespread availability of the machines from which the parts came, garden rotary tillers, and their relative cheapness, a hundred dollars or so, kept tiller-foot boats in use for a while. It is also possible, it should be noted, that another possible dimension of the boat\u2019s longevity, despite its mechanical failings, was that many of the tillers came with warranties, and it was not unknown for a failed transmission to be put back into its original box and returned for replacement. In this case, it is possible that one of the factors that contributed to the demise of the tiller-foot boat was that local store owners and equipment dealers eventually caught on to the practice and began to refuse to replace tillers that had exceeded their intended use.[^fn1] In the fall of 1982 two men who farmed and would also later teach agricultural shop held the first crawfish field day, a homegrown version of the larger field days held by state university agricultural colleges throughout the U.S. In addition to getting people to see if sharing ideas wouldn\u2019t make everyone\u2019s lives better, they invited a Texan inventor to show off his crawfish buggy, which looked a bit like a lunar rover set down in a muddy rice field. The operator sat in the middle of four large wheels that tracked through the shallow water reasonably well. He drove right up to a crawfish trap, grabbed it and emptied it to one side. It was an amazing machine, but it appears to have been eclipsed that day by a machine that turned up at the last moment, an off-the-shelf aluminum fishing boat that had a cleated steel wheel hanging off the bow that was driven by a hydraulic pump powered by a small-bore engine. When one of the organizers, Maurice Benoit, saw Ted Habetz\u2019s boat, he turned to his friend and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my boat.\u201d What he meant by that is a tale of two men working simultaneously fifty miles, and years of experience, apart. Both had roots in agriculture; both had professional degrees; and both had had experiences beyond their education and beyond their agricultural roots. As divergent as their educations and experiences were, their convergence on the same solution at the same moment in time suggests that there was a certain inevitability to the idea, that it was, as Kevin Kelley has observed, \u201cwhat the technology wanted.\u201d Habetz ended up taking orders for four boats that first year. Against his own judgment, Benoit took a check for two boats. The pair became the first makers of the modern crawfish boat, which standardized around an aluminum hull mated to a steel drive unit. The drive unit is powered and manipulated by a hydraulic system, allowing the boats, using only one pump, to go forwards and backwards, to steer left and right, and to life the stern of the boat both to clear levees and to travel on roads, making them an indigenous amphibious vehicle. Over time, as the boats became powerful enough to drive over the small levees that separate one cut from another within a rice field, the wheels moved from the front to the back. As the power of the boats increased, so did the stress on commercial hulls, driving all the makers to make their own hulls. The result is a vibrant eco-system of manufacturers, each with their own particular hulls and drive units as well as particular systems for mating one to the other \u2014 those who have seen the hydraulic press channel on Youtube are familiar with the power of hydraulics to slowly transform almost anything from one shape into another. The men who made the boats are as varied as the boats themselves. By and large, they do not consider themselves inventors; rather, among themselves, they are equipment repairmen, fabricators, welders, and/or farmers, with each man possessing some or all of the skills of these roles to varying degrees. And so the construction of the boat as both a particular object as well as a generalized idea takes place within a larger network of ideas and practices with which all the individuals are familiar but to which they have different kinds of access and with which they have different experiences. Any particular individual could be strictly a farmer, a farmer who fabricates on occasion and only for himself, a farmer who actively fabricates for himself and others, a fabricator who farms or is a member of a farming family, or strictly a fabricator. Out of this assortment of abilities and interests flows a steady stream of innovations and adaptations in response to particular problems: side plows, PTO (power take-off) ditchers and other powered machines attached to tractors, fixed and mobile pumps, small boat hulls (for airboats, hunting boats, and hand-pushed boats), and, in an adjacent network, surface-drive engines. Within this network, nodes are seemingly isolated: each man works alone, separate from the other builders. At the same time, he is also working in dialogue with them. They see each other\u2019s boats. They know what their customers think of the strengths and weaknesses of each design. They recognize imagination in each other, and, in that way, share their creativity. It\u2019s not unlike a guitar player hearing a run or riff, liking it, and including a version of it in his or her next performance. Listening, even indirectly, is what creates an artistic field. Out of that field comes creativity, as artists and craftsmen spur each other on. (Speaking of copying, these men are aware of intellectual property: they just aren\u2019t interested in patents. Rather, they invested in what we now think of as the open source model of reputation.) The network grows and shrinks according to individual interests and abilities of men, and occasional woman, who think best in three-dimensional shapes, in mathematical ratios, and in stress factors. There is room within the network for those who simple want to be workers, as there always is, but the nature of this network is such that there is also room for individuals who want the freedom to construct things of their own imagining. And if there isn\u2019t in one shop, there will be another, or if there is none to be had in the present moment, then some will open shops of their own. Most of these men work alone or with a small collection of trusted others. Often this group is composed of members of their family: brothers, wives, sons. Each man works on that combination of things that interests him and also pays the bills. One likes to design workflows. Another likes anything aluminum. And yet another likes difficult repair jobs. So a landscape filled with a seemingly repetitive series of shops, each possessed of various congregations of men with grease under their fingernails, is actually quite varied. From this heterogeneous network emerged a remarkable consistent, or normalized, product, with various innovations introduced at one node spreading to other nodes, often tweaked to fit within a larger design philosophy. Two examples will suffice: the first is the front wheels and the second are the rodded cleats. The addition of front wheels was an extension of a series of developments. Given rudimentary steering systems, the first hydraulic boats had the drive unit stationed at the front, because boats that are pulled from the front require less active steering than those pushed from the back. (To this day, most farmers will tell you those old boats simply tracked better.) As the powered boats became a larger feature of farm operations, and farmers dedicated more and more cuts and fields to crawfishing, there were a variety of mechanisms that had to be developed to get a boat over a levee, a difficult proposition when the thing that powers your movement is hanging two to four feet in the air as you go up a levee. One fabricator introduced a reversible boat \u2014 it had not only a valve that reversed the hydraulic flow to the motor but also a sloped bow and stern \u2014 and with that the ability for a boat to push itself across a levee was introduced. Once boats could cross levees under their own power, it was not long before farmers were pushing their boats over other obstacles. As one maker remembered: \u201cFarmers kept bringing their boats back with the bottoms wore out. It happened again and again,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I finally asked one of them what was going on. They were going down the road with the thing. Just plowing along a road with it.\u201d Most of the roads between rice fields are dirt lanes, but some have gravel on them, which could hardly be good for a sheet of aluminum bearing hundreds of pounds of man, machinery, and crawfish. There is also, of course, the blacktopped highways that run throughout the region, which are also used by farmers to get from one field to another. The result was an incredible amount of wear in a short amount of time, something that at first perplexed Olinger until he hit upon the solution. \u201cSo I figured as long as they were going down the road, I\u2019d give them wheels.\u201d The wheels were readily adopted by other makers in the network, though, again, each adapted the construal to fit within his own particular design philosophy. Where the original maker had built a box to contain the wheels and then cut a fender into the side of the hull to make accessing them easy, one maker who focuses on the simplicity of design bolted the wheels outside the boat, while another who focuses on the sprung nature of his hulls completely internalized the wheels. A decade later, the boats\u2019 success had led to their slowly spreading geographically, and in so doing, facing somewhat changed environments. In particular, as the boats moved westward along the Western Gulf Prairie, the soils in which they operated were increasingly sandy, leading to the hardened-steel cleats wearing down rather quickly. Some of you will recognize the solution proffered of one maker, who chose to add a length of steel rod along the edge of each cleat. An unanticipated result of the addition of this wear bar was that the boats, which had long been accused of digging ruts into fields, were digging less aggressively. \u00ab\u00bb The iterative process through which the crawfish boat first fluoresced and then solidified is largely one that folklorists would know as tradition. Tradition, like the more contemporary coinage vernacular culture, is useful term, but we as a field too often stop at the notion of face-to-face or person-to-person communication and fail to explore the cognitive dimensions that our approach to the world highlights. In The Amazing Crawfish Boat I slowly built a cognitive model, sketched out somewhat above, that I felt adequately accounted for the many variables inherent in even the small eco-system of ideas, experiences, and desires that produced an indigenous amphibious agricultural machine. It was only after the book was done, that I realized I had been watching my daughter, who is, in some ways, more like the makers in the book than she is like her academic parents, suffer through an instructionist paradigm. Where her parents, either through idiosyncratic preference or through years of careful cultivation, have come to expect, even (perhaps unnecessarily or even dangerously) depend upon tight ontological schema that encompass everything at a sufficiently abstract level before we proceed to do anything else, she just wanted to be able to do something, and to figure out what she needed to figure out as she went along. Fortunately, for her (and me), along with writing a book about guys who during slow moments in the shop like to attempt to calculate how much horsepower it takes to get out of chair or who can tell you the volume of rainfall based on the amount water rises in a field of a given acreage, I was also teaching myself how to code. (Python, if you want to know.) I bought myself several books and despite the numerous small examples sprinkled early and often, proceeded to read them, as if understanding object types, attributes, functions, and methods was something you could simply \u201cread up on.\u201d They aren\u2019t, of which everyone in this room is well aware. At the time, focused mostly on finding ways to engage my daughter in matters I thought were important, especially math, I picked up a copy of Seymour Papert\u2019s Mindstorms. The book is, of course, a marvel of suborning argument: you read it thinking you will get some theory to apply, when in fact its purpose is to re-shape the way you think about thinking. Later, I came across Papert and Idit Harel\u2019s \u201cSituating Constructionism\u201d which holds that building knowledge structures \u201chappens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity\u201d (Papert). This seemed to me a very clear way of saying what folklorists mean when we talk about performance as \u201cfundamentally \u2026 a mode of spoken verbal communication consist[ing] in the assumption of responsibility to an audience for a display of communicative competence.\u201d Folklorist Richard Bauman goes on to note that \u201cPerformance involves on the part of the performer an assumption of accountability to an audience\u2026\u201d (1975: 293). The way natural knowledge construction as we have glimpsed it in the development of the crawfish boat works, as Papert would say, is to put one thing in play and see how it plays out, and the playing out here, like the verbal performances that were the focus of Bauman in his articulation above, is not purely a matter of function but of success within a socio-pragmatic milieu with multiple individuals bringing their own affinities and aversions to the mix. Papert\u2019s objects seemed to me always to occupy an interesting mixed space of both psychological satisfaction and social acceptance. After all, Papert\u2019s definition of constructionism \u201cextend[s] the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product\u201d (Sabelli 2008). \u00ab\u00bb Scholars like Sennett and Ferguson, and a host of others (including many in my own field of folklore studies), are not alone in wishing to re-assert the connection between making and thinking. As Mike Rose notes, there is has been an extensive effort to re-connect hands to heads: There is an extensive philosophical and sociological literature on the meaning of work, and running through much of it is the notion that work provides human beings with a means of engaging the environment, putting their impress on the world. If we accept this notion\u2014and it seems to resonate within a Western cultural context\u2014then we have to acknowledge the ever presence of mind in the work people do, at the least, the monitoring and directing of one\u2019s behavior that enables even the simplest of tasks, and the motives one brings to a task, the reasons for doing it\u2014from economic to social to aesthetic\u2014that affect the execution of it. Historically, much of the effort has focused on re-claiming the skill and intelligence to be found in the trades. There is nothing new about this claim: it seems self-evident. But consider the ways our industrial history has violated it and our social distinctions continue to diminish it. No one doubts the importance of having our houses wired, or plumbed, correctly, nor do they doubt the value of good carpentry, and yet how often are we willing to pay the difference between a cracker jack tradesmen and someone good enough? Do we imagine it as the same kind of difference in value between granite and veneer countertops in our kitchen? Do we, as Mike Rose wonders, seek out the good enough surgeon or the one with \u201cgreat hands\u201d? And yet the carpenter and surgeon undergo similar kinds of training, typically apprenticing themselves to a master skilled in the trade they wish to ply. Both trades involve, as Rose points out, predictable sequences of steps; the ability to respond to variations in the material being worked, be it a patient\u2019s body or a slightly twisted piece of wood or metal; as well as the ability to respond to one\u2019s own missteps. The result is \u201cnot only a repertoire of skillful routines but also a developed sense of how to modify routines to gain a desired effect, a technical suppleness\u201d (154). While a lot has been written about the existential dimensions of making and its ramifications for personal development or aesthetic accomplishment, business scholars Gary Pisano and Willy Shih worry that the loss of making on an industrial scale weakens any nation that lets making get too far away from thinking. The personal computer industry is but one example of what happens, once you divorce making from thinking. Up until Apple\u2019s recent announcement to make certain parts of its computers in the United States, no personal computers were made here. The loss of jobs began with outsourcing of the most basic components, printed circuit boards, to specialist contractors, but slowly those contractors grew to offer more and more capabilities, which American computer makers gladly consigned, holding back for themselves the seemingly more intellectual realms of design, marketing, and customer service. Unfortunately for them, even those functions became outsource-able, and there are now less than a half dozen American computer companies who can claim to have a significant hold on their own supply chain. What gets lost, and what is harder to recover than simply a factory, is the entire eco-system of thinking that is slowly eroded. What made Silicon Valley so important in its day, according to Pisano and Shih, was that software designers and manufacturing engineers would rub elbows at places like restaurants or events like parent-teacher organization meetings. Notes, ideas, and insights could easily be exchanged in a casual atmosphere which might then become instrumental in some product or process innovation. Just as important as those conversations were the conversations engineers would have with men and women on the factory floor, who could point out design ambiguities, and there are always some, as well as potential efficiencies that could not be glimpsed from a CAD screen but can, quite literally, be seen when someone watches a conveyor belt move parts forward. As Pisano and Shih note: \u201cmuch technical knowledge, even in the hard sciences, is highly tacit and therefore more effectively transmitted face-to-face.\u201d[^fn2] What we need to focus on, they argue, are industrial commons, places where ideas can move around and have a high likelihood of falling on fertile ground. Put more simple: proximity is crucial.[^fn3] And yet the last several decades have witnessed the shipping out of manufacturing as a commodity component within the larger chain of \u201cvalue creation\u201d that is the work of modern corporations.

When I came across an announcement for the conference, I recognized that it sat precisely at the intersection of an N-dimensional space with the following axes: the first, and primary, axis is my work as a folklorist to document and to attempt to understand how it is human beings think their way through the world. The second axis is my own attempts to learn how, first, simply to write code, then to work collaboratively with a mathematician and machine learning specialist through code. The third axis is my interest, as a parent of a child who is primarily a world-builder, in finding ways of thinking about thinking and thus thinking about teaching that are conducive to fostering her intellectual, and thus also her emotional, growth. My field of folklore studies is designed, mostly de facto, to force awkward encounters between the modern and the non-modern. That is its intellectual history. Like other outward-looking dimensions of the nineteenth century\u2019s philological project \u2014 which also includes certain parts of anthropology, linguistics, and sociology \u2014 folklore studies asks that its practitioners go out into the world, spend time among some group of them, and then come back to report on how it is with them. The explicit contract, and contrast, is that our society, our modern society, is too complex to understand in toto, and so if we study primitive or peasant societies, they will, through their smallness and/or their simpleness, offer us the chance to understand how it is human societies in general work. Thus, we seek to understand them in order to understand us. Constructing an other is, as we have realized since this mission was founded (starting really before the nineteenth century), not without its problems. Still, folklorists like myself press on, attempting to bring our field and the knowledge it produces more clearly in line with our more nuanced understanding of what it means to create and apply knowledge after Foucault and other post-structuralists necessarily complicated things. So it was with all those qualifications and revisions and concerns in mind that I found myself deciding to spend a number of years seeking to understand how a small network of individuals, working with quite modern materials like steel, aluminum, and hydraulics and with quite modern tools like arc welders, press breaks, and acetylene torches could first conceive and then steadily refine a machine that changed an entire agricultural economy. And they did it all using only what they already knew, whatever that may mean, because then I could call it traditional, and, as it turns out, it was. And so I spent seven years following fabricators and farmers attempting to understand not only the amazing machine they had willed into being but how that machine reflected their own, native understanding of the landscape on which they worked and the world within which they imagined themselves. (For those interested, I wrote an entire book about it.) There were a number of dimensions to the work but the one I wish to focus on here is how ideas get made in the world. Linguists and computer scientists have long described languages that people use in the world to communicate directly with each other and those they use to communicate with computers as natural languages. Natural languages are distinct from formal languages, such as those used in programming, and constructed languages, such as those developed to standardize communication. It would not be unacceptable to extend the concept of \u201cnatural\u201d used in this way to describe natural knowledge construction (or NKC) as the way that humans construct knowledge when they are in communication with each other. Such a description of NKC captures that such knowledge can exist alongside, and often in dialogue with, formal knowledges that users have received either through various formal education protocols and processes: schools and workshops, in particular, play a large role in the agricultural communities in which the current case study takes place. We have not thought as clearly about the relationships between the kinds knowledge available to us because we have, until this moment, not needed to, both because the varieties of practical knowledge were quite strong and also because propositional knowledge did not, as it does in the age mass distribution combined with automated, well, everything, threaten to make practical knowledge unnecessary. In any discussion we might have following the case study, it will be worth our while to consider the necessary balance practical knowledge brings to knowledge in general and, in fact, the enhancements it offers to any epistemology. But before we proceed to the case study I must confess that I am blurring two levels of abstraction in my treatment of this matter: it strikes me that there are actually three ways of treating knowledge: as a theory, as a practice, and in between those two lies history. What I offer here is a narrative in hopes of giving you some sense of the operations at work in a very real context. \u00ab\u00bb The crawfish boat offers us a window onto natural knowledge construction: its recent development and its use of modern materials and modern construction techniques make it a fringe case for studies of traditional knowledge. The diffuse, informal, heterogeneous network which gave birth to it, and its unclear timeline, make it less compelling to historians of technology. Its small economic footprint makes it uninteresting to economists and business theorists, and its lack of formality in its creation also makes it uninteresting to engineers: the first time I visited one shop, in fact, the owner walked me out to one of his CAM machines and asked me what did I want to know? (I told him I didn\u2019t care one whit for the machines: that everything I wanted to know was inside his head. This got me a peculiar look, but he let me come back again and again.) The birth of the crawfish boat was a moment of opportunism, relying upon the fact that crawfish are native to Louisiana and that the creatures had long been easily caught in any low-lying area prone to flooding. There are oral histories that report crawfish migrations that shut down roads because the sheer volume of the animals made the roads too slick to pass. A great aunt of mine reported grabbing crawfish out of flooded fields with a slotted spoon and an old pot. In her account, the children would give them to the poor people, and in the early twentieth century crawfish were seen as a lower-class food. Post-depression and later war-time nutritional programs touted the crawfish as a valuable, abundant, and cheap source of protein, and that message was redoubled during the cultural renaissance that took place in south Louisiana beginning after the war and taking place alongside the Civil Rights movement. By the late fifties, the town of Breaux Bridge had started its annual Crawfish Festival. Much of the early commercial crawfishing was done in the nearby Atchafalaya swamp, which had been formalized into a flood basin by the federal government following the 1929 flood. The boats and traps used there required little modification from boats and traps used in other applications. At some point in the sixties, however, farmers and landowners started playing with the idea of harvesting crawfish out of flooded fields. To some degree, this was a natural development of people looking for flooded land to crawfish, and there are some anecdotal accounts, perhaps apocryphal (and by apocryphal I mean backward-looking explanations), that it was an outgrowth of some of the fierce hurricanes that inundated Louisiana in the late fifties and in the sixties. By the seventies, rice farmers were regularly allowing people to crawfish otherwise unused fields for pennies on the pound of crawfish. (The economics of crawfish were, from the start, a cash crop that was un- or under-assessed and that made profitable use of fields otherwise lying fallow.) Slowly, it became clear that more money could be made if the farmers harvested the crop for themselves, and it was during the late seventies that a great deal of experimentation occurred. At first, farmers themselves, or often their children pressed into service, ran the fields by placing traps along the perimeter and walking from trap to trap with two five-gallon buckets, one for bait and one for harvested crawfish. Ramping up such an enterprise, and attempting to work inside a cut often involved pulling a bulky boat or, in many cases, towing a bright-blue children\u2019s pool, an image the farmers themselves recall with wry grins. As yields increased, farmers began to want to scale up the process, to bring the same kind of power they enjoyed farming into crawfishing. These were men, as will be discussed in a moment, who were comfortable with a wide variety of farm gear, and, just as important, most had some knowledge of and experience in making or modifying an implement in their own shops or equipment sheds. What happened next is not entirely clear. Memories in the present must reach back forty years and try to piece together, through reference to other events\u2014 often to when a child was born or to what grade they were in\u2014 that otherwise blend together as part of \u201clife on a farm.\u201d The first boats that were built were mechanically driven, with a small engine, five horsepower by most accounts. What exactly they were driving is not immediately clear. A number of folks have described a variety of pulley-and-cable systems that seem better suited to steerage than to powering a boat. More than once I have heard them labeled contraptions, as if that was all there was to say on the subject. Whatever the form of those first few protoboats, they seem to have had the drive unit in the back, similar to the contemporary boats. Out of this initial period of experimentation emerged, in the very late seventies, the \u201ctiller-foot\u201d boat. Like its predecessor, it was built on lightweight boat hulls that were commercially available with the addition of a most extraordinary assemblage: the lower part of a garden rotary tiller driven by a five-horsepower engine separated by a long boom, made in place. At first one steered the machines with a tiller attached to the assembled drive unit, much like you would the outboard motor of a boat, but eventually someone adapted the power-steering cylinder of a car so that steering could be handled more remotely. The tiller-foot boats were used for a number of years, but the fact that the drive units were assembled from such disparate parts meant the units were short-lived: the transmission gears, often made of brass, were not intended for such intensive use and would typically fail within a year\u2019s time. The widespread availability of the machines from which the parts came, garden rotary tillers, and their relative cheapness, a hundred dollars or so, kept tiller-foot boats in use for a while. It is also possible, it should be noted, that another possible dimension of the boat\u2019s longevity, despite its mechanical failings, was that many of the tillers came with warranties, and it was not unknown for a failed transmission to be put back into its original box and returned for replacement. In this case, it is possible that one of the factors that contributed to the demise of the tiller-foot boat was that local store owners and equipment dealers eventually caught on to the practice and began to refuse to replace tillers that had exceeded their intended use.[^fn1] In the fall of 1982 two men who farmed and would also later teach agricultural shop held the first crawfish field day, a homegrown version of the larger field days held by state university agricultural colleges throughout the U.S. In addition to getting people to see if sharing ideas wouldn\u2019t make everyone\u2019s lives better, they invited a Texan inventor to show off his crawfish buggy, which looked a bit like a lunar rover set down in a muddy rice field. The operator sat in the middle of four large wheels that tracked through the shallow water reasonably well. He drove right up to a crawfish trap, grabbed it and emptied it to one side. It was an amazing machine, but it appears to have been eclipsed that day by a machine that turned up at the last moment, an off-the-shelf aluminum fishing boat that had a cleated steel wheel hanging off the bow that was driven by a hydraulic pump powered by a small-bore engine. When one of the organizers, Maurice Benoit, saw Ted Habetz\u2019s boat, he turned to his friend and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my boat.\u201d What he meant by that is a tale of two men working simultaneously fifty miles, and years of experience, apart. Both had roots in agriculture; both had professional degrees; and both had had experiences beyond their education and beyond their agricultural roots. As divergent as their educations and experiences were, their convergence on the same solution at the same moment in time suggests that there was a certain inevitability to the idea, that it was, as Kevin Kelley has observed, \u201cwhat the technology wanted.\u201d Habetz ended up taking orders for four boats that first year. Against his own judgment, Benoit took a check for two boats. The pair became the first makers of the modern crawfish boat, which standardized around an aluminum hull mated to a steel drive unit. The drive unit is powered and manipulated by a hydraulic system, allowing the boats, using only one pump, to go forwards and backwards, to steer left and right, and to life the stern of the boat both to clear levees and to travel on roads, making them an indigenous amphibious vehicle. Over time, as the boats became powerful enough to drive over the small levees that separate one cut from another within a rice field, the wheels moved from the front to the back. As the power of the boats increased, so did the stress on commercial hulls, driving all the makers to make their own hulls. The result is a vibrant eco-system of manufacturers, each with their own particular hulls and drive units as well as particular systems for mating one to the other \u2014 those who have seen the hydraulic press channel on Youtube are familiar with the power of hydraulics to slowly transform almost anything from one shape into another. The men who made the boats are as varied as the boats themselves. By and large, they do not consider themselves inventors; rather, among themselves, they are equipment repairmen, fabricators, welders, and/or farmers, with each man possessing some or all of the skills of these roles to varying degrees. And so the construction of the boat as both a particular object as well as a generalized idea takes place within a larger network of ideas and practices with which all the individuals are familiar but to which they have different kinds of access and with which they have different experiences. Any particular individual could be strictly a farmer, a farmer who fabricates on occasion and only for himself, a farmer who actively fabricates for himself and others, a fabricator who farms or is a member of a farming family, or strictly a fabricator. Out of this assortment of abilities and interests flows a steady stream of innovations and adaptations in response to particular problems: side plows, PTO (power take-off) ditchers and other powered machines attached to tractors, fixed and mobile pumps, small boat hulls (for airboats, hunting boats, and hand-pushed boats), and, in an adjacent network, surface-drive engines. Within this network, nodes are seemingly isolated: each man works alone, separate from the other builders. At the same time, he is also working in dialogue with them. They see each other\u2019s boats. They know what their customers think of the strengths and weaknesses of each design. They recognize imagination in each other, and, in that way, share their creativity. It\u2019s not unlike a guitar player hearing a run or riff, liking it, and including a version of it in his or her next performance. Listening, even indirectly, is what creates an artistic field. Out of that field comes creativity, as artists and craftsmen spur each other on. (Speaking of copying, these men are aware of intellectual property: they just aren\u2019t interested in patents. Rather, they invested in what we now think of as the open source model of reputation.) The network grows and shrinks according to individual interests and abilities of men, and occasional woman, who think best in three-dimensional shapes, in mathematical ratios, and in stress factors. There is room within the network for those who simple want to be workers, as there always is, but the nature of this network is such that there is also room for individuals who want the freedom to construct things of their own imagining. And if there isn\u2019t in one shop, there will be another, or if there is none to be had in the present moment, then some will open shops of their own. Most of these men work alone or with a small collection of trusted others. Often this group is composed of members of their family: brothers, wives, sons. Each man works on that combination of things that interests him and also pays the bills. One likes to design workflows. Another likes anything aluminum. And yet another likes difficult repair jobs. So a landscape filled with a seemingly repetitive series of shops, each possessed of various congregations of men with grease under their fingernails, is actually quite varied. From this heterogeneous network emerged a remarkable consistent, or normalized, product, with various innovations introduced at one node spreading to other nodes, often tweaked to fit within a larger design philosophy. Two examples will suffice: the first is the front wheels and the second are the rodded cleats. The addition of front wheels was an extension of a series of developments. Given rudimentary steering systems, the first hydraulic boats had the drive unit stationed at the front, because boats that are pulled from the front require less active steering than those pushed from the back. (To this day, most farmers will tell you those old boats simply tracked better.) As the powered boats became a larger feature of farm operations, and farmers dedicated more and more cuts and fields to crawfishing, there were a variety of mechanisms that had to be developed to get a boat over a levee, a difficult proposition when the thing that powers your movement is hanging two to four feet in the air as you go up a levee. One fabricator introduced a reversible boat \u2014 it had not only a valve that reversed the hydraulic flow to the motor but also a sloped bow and stern \u2014 and with that the ability for a boat to push itself across a levee was introduced. Once boats could cross levees under their own power, it was not long before farmers were pushing their boats over other obstacles. As one maker remembered: \u201cFarmers kept bringing their boats back with the bottoms wore out. It happened again and again,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I finally asked one of them what was going on. They were going down the road with the thing. Just plowing along a road with it.\u201d Most of the roads between rice fields are dirt lanes, but some have gravel on them, which could hardly be good for a sheet of aluminum bearing hundreds of pounds of man, machinery, and crawfish. There is also, of course, the blacktopped highways that run throughout the region, which are also used by farmers to get from one field to another. The result was an incredible amount of wear in a short amount of time, something that at first perplexed Olinger until he hit upon the solution. \u201cSo I figured as long as they were going down the road, I\u2019d give them wheels.\u201d The wheels were readily adopted by other makers in the network, though, again, each adapted the construal to fit within his own particular design philosophy. Where the original maker had built a box to contain the wheels and then cut a fender into the side of the hull to make accessing them easy, one maker who focuses on the simplicity of design bolted the wheels outside the boat, while another who focuses on the sprung nature of his hulls completely internalized the wheels. A decade later, the boats\u2019 success had led to their slowly spreading geographically, and in so doing, facing somewhat changed environments. In particular, as the boats moved westward along the Western Gulf Prairie, the soils in which they operated were increasingly sandy, leading to the hardened-steel cleats wearing down rather quickly. Some of you will recognize the solution proffered of one maker, who chose to add a length of steel rod along the edge of each cleat. An unanticipated result of the addition of this wear bar was that the boats, which had long been accused of digging ruts into fields, were digging less aggressively. \u00ab\u00bb The iterative process through which the crawfish boat first fluoresced and then solidified is largely one that folklorists would know as tradition. Tradition, like the more contemporary coinage vernacular culture, is useful term, but we as a field too often stop at the notion of face-to-face or person-to-person communication and fail to explore the cognitive dimensions that our approach to the world highlights. In The Amazing Crawfish Boat I slowly built a cognitive model, sketched out somewhat above, that I felt adequately accounted for the many variables inherent in even the small eco-system of ideas, experiences, and desires that produced an indigenous amphibious agricultural machine. It was only after the book was done, that I realized I had been watching my daughter, who is, in some ways, more like the makers in the book than she is like her academic parents, suffer through an instructionist paradigm. Where her parents, either through idiosyncratic preference or through years of careful cultivation, have come to expect, even (perhaps unnecessarily or even dangerously) depend upon tight ontological schema that encompass everything at a sufficiently abstract level before we proceed to do anything else, she just wanted to be able to do something, and to figure out what she needed to figure out as she went along. Fortunately, for her (and me), along with writing a book about guys who during slow moments in the shop like to attempt to calculate how much horsepower it takes to get out of chair or who can tell you the volume of rainfall based on the amount water rises in a field of a given acreage, I was also teaching myself how to code. (Python, if you want to know.) I bought myself several books and despite the numerous small examples sprinkled early and often, proceeded to read them, as if understanding object types, attributes, functions, and methods was something you could simply \u201cread up on.\u201d They aren\u2019t, of which everyone in this room is well aware. At the time, focused mostly on finding ways to engage my daughter in matters I thought were important, especially math, I picked up a copy of Seymour Papert\u2019s Mindstorms. The book is, of course, a marvel of suborning argument: you read it thinking you will get some theory to apply, when in fact its purpose is to re-shape the way you think about thinking. Later, I came across Papert and Idit Harel\u2019s \u201cSituating Constructionism\u201d which holds that building knowledge structures \u201chappens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity\u201d (Papert). This seemed to me a very clear way of saying what folklorists mean when we talk about performance as \u201cfundamentally \u2026 a mode of spoken verbal communication consist[ing] in the assumption of responsibility to an audience for a display of communicative competence.\u201d Folklorist Richard Bauman goes on to note that \u201cPerformance involves on the part of the performer an assumption of accountability to an audience\u2026\u201d (1975: 293). The way natural knowledge construction as we have glimpsed it in the development of the crawfish boat works, as Papert would say, is to put one thing in play and see how it plays out, and the playing out here, like the verbal performances that were the focus of Bauman in his articulation above, is not purely a matter of function but of success within a socio-pragmatic milieu with multiple individuals bringing their own affinities and aversions to the mix. Papert\u2019s objects seemed to me always to occupy an interesting mixed space of both psychological satisfaction and social acceptance. After all, Papert\u2019s definition of constructionism \u201cextend[s] the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product\u201d (Sabelli 2008). \u00ab\u00bb Scholars like Sennett and Ferguson, and a host of others (including many in my own field of folklore studies), are not alone in wishing to re-assert the connection between making and thinking. As Mike Rose notes, there is has been an extensive effort to re-connect hands to heads: There is an extensive philosophical and sociological literature on the meaning of work, and running through much of it is the notion that work provides human beings with a means of engaging the environment, putting their impress on the world. If we accept this notion\u2014and it seems to resonate within a Western cultural context\u2014then we have to acknowledge the ever presence of mind in the work people do, at the least, the monitoring and directing of one\u2019s behavior that enables even the simplest of tasks, and the motives one brings to a task, the reasons for doing it\u2014from economic to social to aesthetic\u2014that affect the execution of it. Historically, much of the effort has focused on re-claiming the skill and intelligence to be found in the trades. There is nothing new about this claim: it seems self-evident. But consider the ways our industrial history has violated it and our social distinctions continue to diminish it. No one doubts the importance of having our houses wired, or plumbed, correctly, nor do they doubt the value of good carpentry, and yet how often are we willing to pay the difference between a cracker jack tradesmen and someone good enough? Do we imagine it as the same kind of difference in value between granite and veneer countertops in our kitchen? Do we, as Mike Rose wonders, seek out the good enough surgeon or the one with \u201cgreat hands\u201d? And yet the carpenter and surgeon undergo similar kinds of training, typically apprenticing themselves to a master skilled in the trade they wish to ply. Both trades involve, as Rose points out, predictable sequences of steps; the ability to respond to variations in the material being worked, be it a patient\u2019s body or a slightly twisted piece of wood or metal; as well as the ability to respond to one\u2019s own missteps. The result is \u201cnot only a repertoire of skillful routines but also a developed sense of how to modify routines to gain a desired effect, a technical suppleness\u201d (154). While a lot has been written about the existential dimensions of making and its ramifications for personal development or aesthetic accomplishment, business scholars Gary Pisano and Willy Shih worry that the loss of making on an industrial scale weakens any nation that lets making get too far away from thinking. The personal computer industry is but one example of what happens, once you divorce making from thinking. Up until Apple\u2019s recent announcement to make certain parts of its computers in the United States, no personal computers were made here. The loss of jobs began with outsourcing of the most basic components, printed circuit boards, to specialist contractors, but slowly those contractors grew to offer more and more capabilities, which American computer makers gladly consigned, holding back for themselves the seemingly more intellectual realms of design, marketing, and customer service. Unfortunately for them, even those functions became outsource-able, and there are now less than a half dozen American computer companies who can claim to have a significant hold on their own supply chain. What gets lost, and what is harder to recover than simply a factory, is the entire eco-system of thinking that is slowly eroded. What made Silicon Valley so important in its day, according to Pisano and Shih, was that software designers and manufacturing engineers would rub elbows at places like restaurants or events like parent-teacher organization meetings. Notes, ideas, and insights could easily be exchanged in a casual atmosphere which might then become instrumental in some product or process innovation. Just as important as those conversations were the conversations engineers would have with men and women on the factory floor, who could point out design ambiguities, and there are always some, as well as potential efficiencies that could not be glimpsed from a CAD screen but can, quite literally, be seen when someone watches a conveyor belt move parts forward. As Pisano and Shih note: \u201cmuch technical knowledge, even in the hard sciences, is highly tacit and therefore more effectively transmitted face-to-face.\u201d[^fn2] What we need to focus on, they argue, are industrial commons, places where ideas can move around and have a high likelihood of falling on fertile ground. Put more simple: proximity is crucial.[^fn3] And yet the last several decades have witnessed the shipping out of manufacturing as a commodity component within the larger chain of \u201cvalue creation\u201d that is the work of modern corporations.","title":"Repairing Knowledge: A Case Study in Natural Knowledge Construction"},{"location":"texts/Construit 2017/#references","text":"Bauman, Richard. 1996. \u201cFolklore as Transdisciplinary Dialogue.\u201d Journal of Folklore Research 33 (1) (January 1): 15\u201320.
